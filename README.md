# NumberForChilds
This project constructs a specific list of numbers from 0 to 100 in order to familiarize young children with them.
several scenarios are described below and many others can be imagined.
## simple vocal enumeration 
My 3 1/2 year old daughter likes to name all the numbers one by one, following the spider's web with her finger.    
If she's wrong we tell her the right nale . Quickly, she was proud to do the whole without error  up to the hundred.   
## A race between children
This race is played with a a six-sided die and some pawns, one per player, up to 4 seems enough.   
Starting at 0 on the spider, each child throw the dice and move forward as many boxes, naming the start, the value of the die and the arrival box.  
If the child does not know how to add and is at this time unable to name the destination box, he will move his pawn box by box while counting. After several play, some additions will be known and named directly.   
### Bonus box  
Some box have a red point (in fact prime numbers)  which allows player to replay immediately if he arrives on. 
### end of race 
The game runs until every child has reached 100 and leave the web to reach the garden.  
## race with magic digit 
Each player can choose his favorite digit from 1 to 9.  Each time he goes to a box that ends by his digit, he can do a jump onto the next level of this digit (+10).   
To insure equivalence of digits, if the destination box has also a red point, he's not allowed to play again as from a standard access.   
( If you look at web, prime numbers are mainly ended by digit 1,3,7 and 9)   
## use as an abacus   
The web can be used as an abacus: we choose a number, we put a master pawn on it and ask child to throw the dice then count on the target to give the right answer. Can imagine any kind of rewards.  
## the spider against the ladybirds 
One player is the spider , the others ladybirds.   
Ladybirds will play three times before spider starts.   
Every player throw a dice to advance on web but this time is allowed to go forward or backward :   
- The ladybirds mainly forward to get out of web but sometime backward if the count will fall on the spider box which can be in front.  
- The spider forward to catch ladybird or backward if it has passed some. 
If spider catch ladybird, the game is over for it.    
This game is a kind of introduction to the substraction.    






# Running the app to construct web image
A script (for mac) **py.command** launch a micro server **server.py** and run a chrome brower onto **http://localhost:8081/sketches**    
One can start by himself the server by **python3 server.py** then go to the url  **http://localhost:8081/sketches** with his prefered browser.
